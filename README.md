#### About Hermes
Document Management System, complete with roles and privileges. Each document defines access rights; the document defines which roles can access it.

#### Limitations:
The limitations to the Document Management System API are as follows:

* Users can only create plain textual documents and retrieve same when needed.
* Users cannot share documents with people, but can make document `public` to make it available to other users.

#### _**Contributing**_
Contributors are welcome to further enhance the features of this API by contributing to its development.
